# Assignment 0 (0 marks)

This is a practice assignment to help you get familiar with markdown langauge and submission process for assignments/labs.

## Markdown Syntax

As part of all assignments and labs, you will be required to submit a `README.md` file. This file will contain your answers to the questions in the assignment/lab. You will be required to use markdown syntax to format your answers. You can find a cheat sheet for markdown syntax [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.

More information about markdown can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

## Markdown Applications

Here is a list of IDEs/Editors that support markdown:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

I personally recommend using Visual Studio Code, as it is a very powerful IDE that supports many languages and has many extensions that can be used to make your life easier. Sublime Text is also a great option, with a very clean interface and many extensions.

## Favourite Animal

As part of this practice assignment, we would like you to include an image of your favourite animal. Please create a folder called `images` and include an image of your favourite animal in that folder. Then, include the image in the `README` file. Make sure to cite the source of the image using the markdown syntax:

```markdown
[title](https://www.example.com)
```

Remember, to include an image in markdown (.md) file, you can use the following syntax:

```markdown
![](path/to/file/image.png)

Example - if a file called test.png was located in this folder:
![alt-text](test.jpeg)
```
